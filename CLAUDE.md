# Claude Code Rules

## Git Commits
- Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines to commit messages
- Never add any AI/Claude/Anthropic attribution to commits

## Recipes
- When adding a new recipe, always add it to the README.md in the appropriate category section, in alphabetical order
- All recipe files live under `recipes/` organized by category (appetizers, breads, desserts, mains, sauces, sides)
