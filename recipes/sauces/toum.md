| **Cuisine** | Lebanese |
| **Servings** | ~2 cups |
| **Prep Time** | 15 minutes |
| **Total Time** | 15 minutes |

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Garlic cloves, peeled | 1 cup (~2 heads) | 130 g |
| Salt | 1 tsp | 5 g |
| Lemon juice, fresh | 3–4 tbsp | 45–60 ml |
| Neutral oil (canola, vegetable, or light olive oil) | 3 cups | 720 ml |
| Ice water | 2–3 tbsp | 30–45 ml |

## Instructions

1. Add the garlic and salt to a food processor. Process until finely minced and a paste forms, scraping down the sides as needed.
2. With the processor running, add 1 tbsp of lemon juice and continue processing until smooth.
3. Begin drizzling in the oil very slowly — just a thin, steady stream. This is the most important step; adding oil too fast will break the emulsion.
4. After about 1 cup of oil, add another 1 tbsp of lemon juice while still processing. Continue the slow drizzle of oil.
5. After another cup of oil, add 1 tbsp of ice water and the remaining lemon juice. Continue drizzling the rest of the oil.
6. Add 1–2 more tbsp of ice water as needed to keep the emulsion smooth and fluffy. The finished toum should be thick, white, and fluffy — similar to the texture of whipped cream or mayonnaise.

## Notes

- The oil must be added in a very slow, thin stream — patience is everything. If the emulsion breaks, start with a fresh egg white or a small amount of new garlic in a clean processor and slowly drizzle the broken mixture back in.
- Use room-temperature garlic and cold oil for the best results.
- Toum keeps in the fridge for up to a month. The garlic flavor mellows over time.
- Pairs perfectly with the [Chicken Shawarma Platter](../mains/chicken/chicken-shawarma-platter.md).
