## Instructions

### Sauce (day before)
1. Whisk together all sauce ingredients until smooth. Cover and refrigerate overnight to let the flavors meld.

### Crust
1. Heat oven to 475°F (245°C).
2. Prepare an 18x13 inch sheet pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, powdered milk, sugar, yeast, and salt.
4. Stir the oil into the warm water, then pour into the dry ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms with no dry flour remaining.
5. Using your fingertips, press and stretch the dough evenly across the prepared pan. If the dough springs back, let it rest for 5 minutes before continuing.
6. Par-bake the crust for 8-10 minutes until set but not browned. Remove from oven.

### Filling
1. Cook the sausage and ground beef together in a skillet, breaking into small crumbles and seasoning with salt and pepper. Drain excess fat.

### Assembly
1. Spread the sauce evenly over the par-baked crust.
2. Distribute the cooked meat over the sauce.
3. Top with shredded or cubed mozzarella.
4. Return to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes until the cheese is melted and beginning to brown.
5. Rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
