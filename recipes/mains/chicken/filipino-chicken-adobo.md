> Intense in flavor but fast and easy. The chicken is so tender it eats like it's been slow-cooked.

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Chicken thigh fillets, boneless skinless | 1.5 lb (5-6 pieces) | 750g |
| Garlic, minced | 3 cloves | 3 cloves |
| Soy sauce (all-purpose or light, not dark) | ⅓ cup | 85ml |
| White vinegar | ⅓ cup + 2 tbsp | 100ml |
| Bay leaves | 4 fresh or 3 dried | 4 fresh or 3 dried |

### For Cooking
| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Oil (vegetable, canola, or peanut) | 2 tbsp, separated | 30ml |
| Garlic, minced | 3 cloves | 3 cloves |
| Brown onion, diced | 1 small | 1 small |
| Water | 1½ cups | 375ml |
| Brown sugar | 2 tbsp | 24g |
| Whole black pepper (or 2 tsp coarse cracked) | 1 tbsp | 1 tbsp |

### For Serving
| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Green onions/scallions, sliced | 2 | 2 |

## Instructions

1. Place the chicken in a bowl with the garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and bay leaves. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes, or overnight in the refrigerator for deeper flavor.
2. Heat half the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Lift the chicken from the marinade (save the liquid) and sear until golden on both sides, about 1 minute per side. The chicken should not be cooked through. Transfer to a plate.
3. Add the remaining oil to the skillet and sauté the garlic and onion until softened and aromatic.
4. Pour in the reserved marinade along with the water, brown sugar, and peppercorns. Stir and bring to a simmer, then cook for 5 minutes.
5. Return the chicken to the pan, placing it smooth-side down. Let it simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the sauce has reduced to a thick, glossy glaze.
6. If the sauce needs more time to reduce, temporarily remove the chicken and let the liquid cook down further before returning the chicken to coat.
7. Serve the glazed chicken over rice and top with sliced green onions.

## Notes

Do NOT substitute with chicken breast - you need the fat in thighs for the sauce to reduce to a glaze. For bone-in thighs, wings, or drumsticks, add ¾ cup water and simmer 30 minutes.

Use all-purpose or light soy sauce, not dark soy sauce.

Leftover sauce is great for fried rice - it's strong in flavor so a little goes a long way.

White distilled vinegar is preferred for neutral flavor. If using other vinegars (rice wine, white wine, apple cider), start with 40ml and add more to taste at the end.

Pairs well with cauliflower rice and smashed cucumbers for a lighter meal.
