## Instructions

1. Combine chicken and marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.
2. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and sear both sides until browned, about 1 minute each side. Do not cook all the way through.
3. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
4. Heat remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1½ minutes.
5. Add reserved marinade, water, sugar, and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-high. Simmer 5 minutes.
6. Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until sauce reduces to a thick jam-like syrup.
7. If sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken to a plate and let sauce simmer by itself to thicken, then return chicken to coat in glaze.
8. Coat chicken in glaze and serve over rice, garnished with green onions.

## Notes

Do NOT substitute with chicken breast - you need the fat in thighs for the sauce to reduce to a glaze. For bone-in thighs, wings, or drumsticks, add ¾ cup water and simmer 30 minutes.

Use all-purpose or light soy sauce, not dark soy sauce.

Leftover sauce is great for fried rice - it's strong in flavor so a little goes a long way.

White distilled vinegar is preferred for neutral flavor. If using other vinegars (rice wine, white wine, apple cider), start with 40ml and add more to taste at the end.

Pairs well with cauliflower rice and smashed cucumbers for a lighter meal.
