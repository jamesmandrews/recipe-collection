## Directions

### Ricotta Gnocchi

1. Mix ricotta, egg, Parmesan, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl until combined.
2. Gently fold in flour until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Don't overmix.
3. On a floured surface, divide dough into 4 pieces. Roll each into a 3/4-inch rope and cut into 1-inch pieces.
4. Boil in salted water until they float, about 2–3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

### Soup

1. Heat 1 Tbsp sun-dried tomato oil in a Dutch oven over medium. Sauté onion and garlic 3–4 minutes.
2. Stir in tomato paste and sun-dried tomatoes, cook 2 minutes.
3. Add broth, cream, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and red pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low.
4. Stir in spinach, chicken, mascarpone, and Parmesan. Cook 3 minutes until creamy and heated through.
5. Gently fold in the cooked ricotta gnocchi and cook 1–2 minutes more.
6. Garnish with extra Parmesan, basil, and red pepper. Serve hot.
