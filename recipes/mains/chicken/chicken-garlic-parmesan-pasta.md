## Instructions

1. In a large pot, boil pasta according to box directions for al dente. Reserve ¼ cup pasta water before draining.
2. Combine all chicken seasonings in a small bowl: paprika, oregano, garlic powder, thyme, salt, and pepper.
3. Pound chicken down to thin out slightly, then season on both sides.
4. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear chicken for 5 minutes on each side.
5. Flip the chicken and lower heat to medium-low. Cover with a lid and cook for an additional 10-12 minutes until internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
6. Remove chicken from the pan and place onto a cutting board to cool while making the sauce.
7. Add butter to the pan and allow it to melt over medium-low heat.
8. Once melted, add the shallots, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Stir well and simmer for one minute.
9. Add the flour and stir well, scraping the bottom of the pan.
10. Pour in the chicken broth and heavy cream. Whisk until smooth and creamy.
11. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until completely melted. Cook, stirring occasionally, until desired consistency is reached.
12. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat evenly. Add reserved pasta water one tablespoon at a time to thin the sauce if needed.
13. Slice the cooled chicken breast, add to the pasta, and gently stir to combine. Serve immediately.

## Notes

If your sauce is too thick, slowly add reserved pasta water one to two tablespoons at a time to avoid making it runny.

Always salt your pasta water before boiling to prevent sticking. You can also run cold water over the pasta after cooking.

Lower the heat before adding butter to the pan to avoid burning it.

Remove the chicken from heat as soon as it reaches 165°F (74°C). Let it cool completely while making the sauce before slicing to retain moisture.

**Storage:** Refrigerate for up to 3 days in an airtight container. Reheat in a skillet over medium-low heat or microwave individual portions at 1-minute intervals.
