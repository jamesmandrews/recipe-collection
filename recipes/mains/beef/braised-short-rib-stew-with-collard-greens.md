## Instructions

### Sear the Ribs
1. Pat the short ribs dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Sear the ribs on all sides until deeply golden, about 4–5 minutes total.
3. Pour in the red wine, let it bubble for 1–2 minutes, then lower the heat to a gentle simmer. Cover and braise for 2 hours, peeking now and then. If the pot looks dry, add a splash of wine, stock, or water to keep things moist.

### Build the Stew
4. Lift the ribs out of the pot and set aside. Add the mushrooms to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes. Toss in the onions, shallots, and garlic, then sauté for another 5 minutes until softened.
5. Stir in the tomato paste and beef base until well combined, then pour in the beef stock. Add the potatoes and collard greens. Nestle the ribs back in, bring everything to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and let it simmer for 2–3 hours, until the greens are silky and the meat is fork-tender.

### Thicken & Finish
6. Combine the cold water and flour in a jar, seal, and shake vigorously until smooth. Pour the slurry into the stew along with the carrots.
7. Continue simmering uncovered for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the broth thickens and the carrots are tender.
8. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed. Ladle into bowls and top with fresh parsley.

## Notes

- Pairs beautifully with cornbread or served over rice.
