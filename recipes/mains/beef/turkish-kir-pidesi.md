## Ingredients

### Dough

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| All-purpose flour | 4¼ cups | 600 g |
| Warm water | 1⅔ cups | 400 ml |
| Active dry yeast | 1 tbsp | 15 g |
| Vegetable oil | 3 tbsp | 45 ml |
| Salt | 2 tsp | 10 g |

### Filling

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Ground beef | 1.1 lbs | 500 g |
| Green peppers | 2 | 2 |
| Red pepper | 1 | 1 |
| Onions | 2 | 2 |
| Butter (or tail fat) | 3.5 oz | 100 g |
| Salt | to taste | to taste |
| Black pepper | to taste | to taste |
| Red pepper flakes | to taste | to taste |

## Instructions

### Dough

1. Combine the flour, warm water, yeast, vegetable oil, and salt in a stand mixer. Knead until a smooth dough forms.
2. Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, until roughly doubled in size.
3. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

### Filling

4. Pass the ground beef, peppers, and onions through a meat grinder (or pulse in a food processor until finely minced).
5. Add the butter, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Mix thoroughly until well combined.
6. **Important:** Make sure all the vegetables and meat are well drained of excess moisture before combining. Too much liquid will soften the dough during resting and after baking.

### Assemble and Bake

7. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
8. Flatten each dough ball by pressing it out by hand. Spread a portion of the filling over the surface.
9. Shape the pide by folding and pinching the edges to form the traditional boat or oval shape, leaving the filling exposed in the center.
10. Place on parchment-lined baking sheets and bake for 20-25 minutes until the dough is golden and the filling is cooked through.

## Notes

- Tail fat (kuyruk yağı) is traditional and adds a distinctive richness, but butter works well as a substitute.
- Draining excess moisture from the vegetables and meat is the most critical step — wet filling leads to soggy pide.
- Measurements are converted from Turkish units (su bardağı / tatlı kaşığı). Adjust flour as needed for a workable dough.
