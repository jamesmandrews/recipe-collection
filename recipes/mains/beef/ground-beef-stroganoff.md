## Instructions

### Vegetables

1. Heat a large pan over medium-high heat. Saute the sliced onions and mushrooms until the onions are nicely caramelized. Remove from the pan and set aside.

### Beef

2. Using the same pan, brown the ground beef, breaking it into crumbles as it cooks. Drain off the excess fat.
3. Season the beef with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, 1 tbsp of soy sauce, and 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. Allow it to cook a bit longer until the edges get slightly crispy.

### Sauce

4. Add the butter to the pan and let it melt, then sprinkle in the flour, stirring to form a roux.
5. Slowly pour in a small amount of the beef broth and heavy whipping cream, stirring constantly until the roux loosens and becomes smooth. Gradually add the remaining liquid while continuing to stir.
6. Stir in the remaining 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp of soy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed — you may want additional soy sauce, Worcestershire, or salt.
7. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let it thicken.

### Finish

8. Return the sauteed onions and mushrooms to the pan and stir to combine. Serve alongside roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes.

## Notes

- The heavy whipping cream is optional — the dish is still excellent without it.
- Adjust the ground beef quantity to suit your family's needs.
- For a thicker sauce, increase the butter and flour in the roux.
- Taste and adjust seasonings throughout — the soy sauce and Worcestershire are key to building depth of flavor.
