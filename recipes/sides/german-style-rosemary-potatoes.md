## Instructions

1. Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add ¼ cup salt and stir until dissolved.
2. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook for about 10 minutes. Potatoes should be 75-80% cooked and still a bit firm.
3. Strain off the water.
4. Heat 2-3 tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan over high heat.
5. Add onions and garlic, cook for 2-3 minutes stirring occasionally. Salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to medium/medium-high.
6. Add potatoes to the pan.
7. Liberally drizzle 4-6 tablespoons olive oil over the potatoes. (It may seem like a lot, but the oil will reduce by serving time.)
8. Add salt, pepper, and dried herbs to taste.
9. Add about ¾ of the chopped rosemary.
10. Stir everything together, ensuring potatoes are completely coated in herbs and oil.
11. Cook over medium/medium-high heat for about 30 minutes, stirring/tossing several times. Potatoes are done when a fork goes through with just a slight bit of firmness remaining.
12. Serve hot, garnished with remaining fresh rosemary.
