## Instructions

### Potato Mixture
1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into roughly 2-inch pieces. Boil in salted water until they're easily pierced with a fork, then drain well.
2. Transfer to a large bowl and mash until smooth. Stir in the corn starch, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, dried parsley, and grated Parmesan. Mix until the combination comes together into a workable dough.

### Assemble
1. Grab a portion of the potato mixture and flatten it in your palm. Place a mozzarella square in the center, then fold the potato around it and roll into a smooth ball. Repeat with the remaining filling and cheese.

### Breading
1. Set up three shallow bowls: one with the dry batter (flour, corn starch, salt, pepper, garlic powder), one with the egg wash (eggs whisked with water), and one with the panko mixed with parsley.
2. Roll each ball first in the dry batter, then dip through the egg wash, and finally coat evenly in the panko mixture.

### Fry
1. Heat oil to 350 °F (175 °C). Fry the balls in batches for 2–3 minutes, turning as needed, until golden brown and crispy all over.
2. Drain briefly on paper towels, then finish with a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and serve right away.
