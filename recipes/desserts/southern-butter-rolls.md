## Instructions

### Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 350 °F (175 °C). Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish.

### Dough
2. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
3. Add the milk and melted butter. Stir until a soft dough forms.
4. Knead lightly for about 30 seconds.
5. Roll the dough into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle (about 12×16 inches).

### Filling & Assembly
6. Spread the softened butter over the dough.
7. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the butter (and cinnamon, if using).
8. Roll the dough tightly into a log.
9. Slice the log into 1 1/2 to 2-inch thick rounds.
10. Place the rounds in the prepared baking dish with small gaps between them.

### Syrup
11. Heat the milk (or water), sugar, butter, vanilla, and salt together until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves. Stir in molasses or brown sugar if using.
12. Pour the hot syrup around and between the rolls until the liquid comes about halfway up the sides.

### Bake
13. Bake for 45–55 minutes until the rolls are golden, the syrup is bubbling, and the sauce has thickened.
14. Let stand 10–15 minutes before serving. Serve warm and scoop generously.

## Notes

- **Milk vs. water for syrup:** Milk produces a richer, custard-like syrup. Water gives a lighter, more traditional variation.
- The syrup will look like too much liquid going in — this is normal. It thickens and becomes caramelized during baking.
