## Instructions

### Burnt Sugar Syrup

1. Melt the sugar in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat until it reaches a deep amber color. Do not stir — swirl the pan gently to ensure even melting.
2. Carefully pour in the boiling water (it will bubble violently). Stir until smooth, then simmer for 3-5 minutes.
3. Cool the syrup completely. Reserve ½ cup for the cake batter and ½ cup for the frosting.

### Cake

1. Heat the oven to 350°F / 175°C. Grease and flour three 8-inch round cake pans.
2. Cream the butter and sugar together for 3-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
3. Whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and milk into the batter in three additions, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.
4. Fold in the burnt sugar syrup and vanilla until evenly incorporated.
5. Divide the batter evenly among the three prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
6. Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks and cool completely before frosting.

### Traditional Burnt Sugar Frosting (work fast!)

1. Combine the butter, brown sugar, burnt sugar syrup, and evaporated milk in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
2. Remove from heat and cool until warm to the touch.
3. Beat in the powdered sugar, salt, and vanilla until smooth and spreadable. Frost the cake quickly before the frosting sets.

### Optional Brown Sugar Penuche Frosting

1. Melt ¾ cup of the butter in a saucepan. Add the brown sugar, heavy cream, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
2. Pour the hot mixture over the powdered sugar and beat until smooth.
3. Add the remaining ¾ cup butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating after each addition.
4. Let the frosting rest for 10-30 minutes until it reaches a spreadable consistency.

### Assembly

1. Place the first cake layer on a serving plate. Spread with traditional burnt sugar frosting. Repeat with the second and third layers.
2. Frost the top and sides with the traditional burnt sugar frosting.
3. Optionally, cover the outside with the penuche frosting for a creamier finish.
4. Finish with rustic swoops and swirls.

## Notes

- This cake is a piece of Black culinary history — a beloved celebration cake in Black Southern communities that faded as convenience baking took hold. Bringing it back honors that tradition.
- The burnt sugar syrup is the soul of this cake. Take your time getting a deep amber caramel — too light and you lose the distinctive flavor.
- The traditional frosting sets quickly, so have your cake layers ready and work fast once you start frosting.
- The penuche frosting is more forgiving and creamier, making it a good option for the outside if you want a more polished finish.
- Make the burnt sugar syrup first and let it cool while you prepare the cake batter.
