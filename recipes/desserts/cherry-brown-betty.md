## Instructions

### Prep
1. Preheat the oven to 350 °F (175 °C). Generously butter a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.

### Cherry Filling
2. Toss the cherries with both sugars, lemon juice, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl. In a small dish, stir the cornstarch into the cold water until smooth, then fold the slurry into the cherry mixture.

### Assemble
3. In a separate bowl, combine the challah cubes with the melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt, tossing until evenly coated. Spread half of the buttered cubes across the bottom of the prepared dish.
4. Spoon the cherry filling over the challah layer in an even layer, then scatter the remaining challah cubes on top.

### Topping & Bake
5. Mix the breadcrumbs, brown sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, and salt together, then sprinkle evenly over the top.
6. Bake for 45–55 minutes, until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges. Let it rest for 15–20 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
