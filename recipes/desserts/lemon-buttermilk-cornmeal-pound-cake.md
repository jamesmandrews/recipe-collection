## Instructions

### Cake
1. Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C). Grease and flour a bundt or tube pan thoroughly.
2. Beat the softened butter and sugar together for 3–5 minutes until the mixture is pale, light, and fluffy.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the lemon zest and vanilla.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
5. Stir the buttermilk and lemon juice together in a measuring cup.
6. With the mixer on low, alternate adding the dry ingredients and the buttermilk mixture in three additions, starting and ending with the dry. Mix just until everything is incorporated — avoid overbeating.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 65–75 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.

### Lemon Glaze
8. Whisk the powdered sugar, lemon juice, melted butter, and salt together until smooth and pourable. Drizzle over the fully cooled cake.

## Notes

- Let dairy ingredients come to room temperature for the best crumb texture.
