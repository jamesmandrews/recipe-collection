## Ingredients

### Pudding
| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Large eggs | 4 | 4 |
| Whole milk | 3 cups | 720 ml |
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup | 200 g |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp | 3 g |
| Vanilla extract | 2 tsp | 10 ml |
| Cooked white rice | 2 cups | 360 g |
| Raisins | 1 cup | 150 g |

### Warm Spice Blend
| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Ground cinnamon | 1/2 tsp | 1 g |
| Ground nutmeg | 1/4 tsp | 0.5 g |
| Ground allspice or cloves | 1/8 tsp | 0.25 g |

## Instructions

### Prep
1. Preheat the oven to 300 °F (150 °C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) casserole dish with butter or nonstick spray.

### Make the Custard
2. Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until smooth, then add the sugar and whisk until slightly pale and well combined.
3. Stir in the milk, salt, vanilla, cooked rice, raisins, and all the spices until everything is evenly distributed.

### Bake
4. Pour the mixture into the prepared dish. Set the dish inside a larger baking pan and carefully pour hot water into the outer pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the pudding dish.
5. Bake for 90 minutes total. About 30 minutes in, gently stir from the bottom edges inward to redistribute the rice and raisins for an even texture.
6. The pudding is done when the center is softly set with a slight jiggle. Remove from the water bath and let it cool — it will continue to thicken as it rests.

## Notes

- Serve warm or chilled. Great on its own or with a dollop of whipped cream.
