## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Bacon strips | 8 | 8 |
| Bacon fat (reserved from cooking) | ¼ cup | 60ml |
| Olive oil | ¾ cup | 180ml |
| Milk | 1 cup | 240ml |
| Eggs | 3 | 3 |
| Shredded sharp cheddar | 1 cup | 115g |

| Tapioca starch | 3 cups | 360g |
| Salt | 3 tbsp | 3 tbsp |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F / 200°C.
2. Cook the bacon in a large pan until crispy. Reserve ¼ cup of the rendered bacon fat.
3. Blend the cooked bacon, reserved bacon fat, olive oil, milk, eggs, both cheddars, tapioca starch, and salt together until smooth.
4. Pour the batter into a greased cupcake pan, filling each cup about ¾ full. Top with extra chopped bacon.
5. Bake until puffed and golden, about 20–25 minutes.

## Notes

- The tapioca starch gives these a chewy, pão de queijo–style texture — gluten-free by nature.
- Don't discard the bacon fat — it's essential for flavor.
- 3 tablespoons of salt is quite generous; taste the batter and adjust to your preference.
