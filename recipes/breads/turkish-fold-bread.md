# Turkish Fold Bread

> A simple no-knead bread using a folding technique instead of kneading to develop structure. The dough stays soft and sticky, producing rustic rolls with a wonderful crust and airy interior.

| **Cuisine** | Turkish |
| **Servings** | 6-9 rolls |
| **Prep Time** | 1 hour 20 minutes (including resting) |
| **Cook Time** | 25-30 minutes |
| **Oven Temp** | 400°F (200°C) |

## Ingredients

### Dough

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Warm water | 2 cups + 2 tbsp | 500 ml |
| Active dry yeast | 1 tbsp | 15 g |
| Sugar | 2 tsp | 10 g |
| All-purpose flour | 3¾ - 4¼ cups | 540 - 600 g |
| Salt | 2 tsp | 10 g |

## Instructions

### Mix and First Rise

1. In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir to dissolve.
2. Add the flour and salt. Using a spatula (not your hands), mix everything together until a shaggy dough forms. The dough should be quite soft and sticky — do not add extra flour.
3. Cover the bowl and let it rest in a warm spot for 20 minutes.

### Folding

4. Wet or lightly oil your hands. Fold the dough over itself several times from the edges toward the center, then gather it into a ball. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes in a warm spot.
5. Repeat the folding and resting process two more times, for a total of three folds at 15-minute intervals.
6. After the final fold, cover and let the dough rest one more time for 15 minutes.

### Shape and Bake

7. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
8. Without folding again, turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface. Divide it into 6 or 9 equal pieces.
9. Place the pieces on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
10. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.

## Notes

- The dough is intentionally very soft and sticky — resist the urge to add more flour, as this is what gives the bread its light, airy texture.
- Wetting or oiling your hands before each fold makes the dough much easier to handle.
- Measurements are converted from Turkish units (su bardağı / tatlı kaşığı) — slight variation in flour amount is normal. Aim for a soft, sticky consistency.
