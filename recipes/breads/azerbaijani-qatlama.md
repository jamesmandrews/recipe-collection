## Instructions

### Make the Dough

1. Warm the milk slightly. Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir, and let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center.
3. Add the yeast mixture, eggs, and vegetable oil to the well. Mix until a soft dough forms.
4. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
5. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.

### Shape and Layer

6. Divide the dough into 8-10 equal pieces and roll each into a ball.
7. On a floured surface, roll each ball out into a thin circle.
8. Brush the surface generously with melted butter.
9. Fold the dough into layers — either roll it up like a log and coil it into a spiral, or fold it in thirds like a letter. Repeat rolling and folding once more to build up flaky layers.
10. Roll the layered dough out again into a flat round, about ¼ inch thick.

### Fry

11. Heat sunflower oil in a deep pan or pot to 340-350°F (170-175°C).
12. Carefully place one qatlama at a time into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes per side until puffed and golden brown.
13. Remove and drain on paper towels.

### Serve

14. While still warm, dust with powdered sugar, sprinkle with granulated sugar, or drizzle with honey.

## Notes

- The original Azerbaijani recipe is traditionally deep-fried for the most authentic result.
- Generous butter between the layers is key — it creates the signature flaky texture.
- Serve warm for the best texture.
