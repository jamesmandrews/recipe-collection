## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Plain yogurt (full fat) | 1/2 cup | 120 g |
| Eggs | 3 | 3 |
| Vanilla extract | 1 tbsp | 15 ml |
| Sugar | 1 cup | 200 g |
| Baking powder | 2 tsp | 2 tsp |
| All-purpose flour | 1 1/2 cups + 1 tbsp | 195 g |
| Vegetable oil | 1/2 cup | 120 ml |
| Fresh blueberries | 2 cups | 300 g |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 °F (175 °C).
2. Blend the yogurt, eggs, vanilla, sugar, baking powder, 1 1/2 cups flour, and vegetable oil until smooth.
3. Toss the blueberries with the remaining 1 tbsp flour, then gently fold them into the batter.
4. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper or coat with butter. Pour in the batter.
5. Bake for about 1 hour, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

## Notes

- Coating the blueberries in flour prevents them from sinking to the bottom of the loaf.
- Full-fat yogurt gives the best texture; low-fat will work but the loaf may be slightly less moist.
