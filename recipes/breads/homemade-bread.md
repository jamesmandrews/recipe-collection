## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Imperial | Metric |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Water | 12.5 oz | 354g |
| Instant yeast | 2¼ tsp | 7g |
| Sugar | 2.5 oz | 70g |
| Bread flour | 22 oz | 625g |
| Powdered milk | 1.1 oz | 32g |
| Salt | 1½ tsp | 9g |
| Butter, room temperature | 2.1 oz | 60g |
| Oil | 1 tbsp | 13g |

## Instructions

### Mix the Dough
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the water, instant yeast, and sugar. Stir until dissolved.
2. Add the bread flour, powdered milk, and salt. Using a stand mixer with a dough hook, mix on low speed for about 2 minutes until the ingredients come together.
3. Increase to medium speed and knead for another 2 minutes to start developing the gluten.

### Add the Butter
1. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the softened butter and oil to the dough.
2. Continue kneading for about 4 minutes until the fats are fully incorporated and the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Add small amounts of flour if the dough is overly sticky.

### First Rise
1. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap.
2. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size. Timing will vary depending on room temperature.

### Shape
1. Once doubled, gently press down the dough to release trapped air.
2. Divide into two portions, shape each into a loaf, and place into greased loaf pans.

### Second Rise
1. Cover the pans and let the dough rise again until nearly doubled. This step improves the final texture.

### Bake
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Bake for approximately 30 minutes until the tops are golden brown. If browning too quickly, tent with foil.
3. Remove from pans and cool completely on a wire rack before slicing or storing.

## Notes

Powdered milk can be replaced with liquid milk. Substitute the water with an equal amount of whole milk, 2% milk, or diluted evaporated milk, and omit the powdered milk.

Flour amounts may vary due to differences in measuring and humidity. Add flour gradually if needed, but avoid adding too much to keep the bread soft.

Warmer environments speed up rising; cooler ones slow it down. Adjust timing based on your kitchen temperature.
