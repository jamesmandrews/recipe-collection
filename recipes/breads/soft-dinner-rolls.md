| **Cuisine** | American |
| **Servings** | About 24 rolls |

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Warm water | 2½ cups |
| Active dry yeast | 2 tbsp |
| Salted butter, melted | ½ cup |
| Salt | 2 tsp |
| Sugar | ½ cup |
| Egg | 1 |
| All-purpose flour | 7 cups |

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let sit for a few minutes until foamy.
2. Add the melted butter, salt, sugar, egg, and flour. Mix and knead for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
3. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 40 minutes.
4. Punch down the dough and divide into rolls.
5. Cover and let rise for another 30 minutes.
6. Bake at 350°F for 22–25 minutes, until golden and soft.

## Notes

- Water should be around 105–110°F — warm enough to activate the yeast but not so hot it kills it.
- For uniform rolls, weigh the total dough and divide evenly.
- Brush with melted butter right out of the oven for a soft, glossy top.
